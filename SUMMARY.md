**Dataset for Advance Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS)** is a dataset for an object detection task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 903 images with 1143 labeled objects belonging to 9 different classes including *pothole*, *left_hand_curve*, *right_hand_curve*, and other: *speed_breaker*, *bridge_ahead*, *pedestrian*, *animal*, *name_board*, and *vehicle*.

Images in the ADAS dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 62 (7% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Also, the dataset contains ***id***, ***camera*** and ***category*** tags. Pothole category with iPhone 12 camera tag also includes ***road_type*** tag. The dataset was released in 2022.
